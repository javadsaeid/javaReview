Abstraction in Java is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It allows you to focus on what an object does instead of how it does it. Abstraction is one of the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

In Java, abstraction can be achieved using:
Definition: A class declared with the abstract keyword. It may contain abstract methods (methods without a body) and non-abstract methods (methods with a body).

Purpose: To define a base class with common properties and methods that subclasses can implement or override.

Key Points:
- Abstract classes cannot be instantiated.
- Subclasses must provide implementations for all abstract methods.


Why Use Abstraction?
 - Simplified Code: Focuses on what an object does without worrying about its implementation.
 - Code Reusability: Abstract classes and interfaces promote reuse through inheritance and polymorphism.
 - Flexibility: Makes it easier to introduce new features or change implementations without breaking existing code.
 - Security: Hides implementation details, exposing only the necessary parts of an object.
By abstracting functionality, Java encourages clean, maintainable, and modular code.
